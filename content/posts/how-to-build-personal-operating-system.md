This week I shipped a major update to my personal operating system—the collection of tools, habits, and frameworks I use to run my life like a high-performing product. Here's what got deployed and what I learned.

## What I Shipped This Week

### Personal Automation Pipeline v2.0

I rebuilt my morning routine automation from scratch after the old system started showing cracks. The new version uses a combination of iOS Shortcuts, Obsidian templates, and a simple Python script that:

- Auto-generates my daily dashboard with weather, calendar, and priority tasks
- Tracks energy levels and sleep quality to adjust workout intensity
- Updates my weekly goals progress and flags what needs attention

**Key insight:** Like any good system, the automation should be invisible until something breaks. The rebuild taught me that personal systems need the same maintenance discipline as production code.

### Physical Performance Sprint Planning

I'm treating my fitness like a software project—complete with sprints, retrospectives, and measurable outcomes. This month's sprint focuses on grip strength and cardiovascular base building, with specific KPIs:

- Farmer's walk distance (current: 100m with 60lbs, target: 150m)
- Resting heart rate improvement (baseline: 65bpm, target: 60bpm)
- Pull-up progression (current: 12 strict, target: 15)

## Integration Wins

The biggest breakthrough was connecting my physical and digital systems. High-intensity workout days now automatically trigger focus mode on my devices and block distracting apps. Low-energy days get tagged for creative work and system maintenance.

**Systems lesson:** The body is hardware, habits are the OS, and your tools are applications. They all need to work together.

## Next Week's Roadmap

Rolling out a new experiment in energy management based on ultradian rhythms—90-minute focused work blocks with deliberate recovery periods. I'm curious if treating attention like a renewable resource will improve both code quality and creative output.

Building yourself is the ultimate full-stack project. You are the product, your tools are your leverage, and your life is your lab.
